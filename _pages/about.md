<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/). -->

Hi! I'm Chan Woong. I got a Bachelor degree in <a href='https://www.hanyang.ac.kr/web/eng'>College of Computing</a> at <a href='https://www.hanyang.ac.kr/web/eng'>Hanyang University</a>, Ansan, Korea(ERICA).

My academic interests lies in natural language processing and computer vision.

<p class="font-weight-bold"> Recently, I have developed an interest in few-shot Dialogue State Tracking (DST), particularly focusing on the application of LLMs with efficient fine-tuning or In-context learning.</p>

From now on, I'm planning to apply graduate school to do further research!
