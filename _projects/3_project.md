<p class="font-weight-bold">Project with <a href='https://www.etri.re.kr/intro.html'>ETRI, Korea</a> (collaborated with <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ls--5v0AAAAJ&hl=en'>Prof.Junseong Bang</a>)</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

POLBOT is an AI-based conversational voice bot service for <a href="https://minwon.police.go.kr/">Korean National Police Agency</a> that recognizes the voice on the phone and seeks to understand the intention of the caller to provide effective automated receptions.
 
By analyzing multiple speakers' voices in real-time, POLBOT can classify speakers and understand their intentions, which allows to provide automated voice responses to callers.

<p class="font-weight-bold">On the necessity of digital conversion of call centers, we developed an XR interface for POLBOT on Microsoft HoloLens 2.</p>


<h3>XR interface</h3>

    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/XR/XR_test1.gif" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">

    voice command and hand gestures
</div>

We developed XR interface with <a href="">MRTK2-unity</a>.  
Applied hand gestures and voice recognition for XR interface interaction.

the project was exhibited at <a href="http://www.aiexpo.co.kr/">AI Expo Korea, 2022</a>.

It was a valuable opportunity to demonstrate my work in front of many people.
