<p class="font-weight-bold">Research Project of POLBOT at <a href="https://www.etri.re.kr/intro.html">ETRI, Korea </a> mentored by <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ls--5v0AAAAJ&hl=en'>Prof.Junseong Bang</a></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

POLBOT is an AI-based conversational voice bot service for <a href="https://minwon.police.go.kr/">Korean National Police Agency</a> that provides automated receptions  of public safety domains.

In POLBOT, Dialogue State Tracking(DST) plays a fundamental role in understanding user's requirements exposed during multi-turn conversations.

However, Due to limitations of acquiring dataset from the police department, I researched few-shot methods of DST and pre-trained language model(PLM).


<p class="font-weight-bold"> We proposed FCN-BLA and implemented real-time Traffic Analysis System.</p>

We proposed FCN-BLA that Improved the architecture of a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.09476">FCN-rLSTM</a> with BI-LSTM and Attention.

Compared to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.09476">FCN-rLSTM</a>,  
    1. Changed to an Encoder-Decoder architecture  
    2. Bidirectionally containing spatio-temporal information from sequential images  
    3. Directly referring to encoded input features for dealing with an existing bottleneck problem  
    
In <a href="https://gram.web.uah.es/data/datasets/trancos/index.html">Trancos Dataset</a>, we obtained 4% performance improvement of count error as 4.205.

  
<h3>Traffic Analysis System</h3>

    <div class="col-sm-6 mt-3 mt-md-0">

Using FCN-BLA, we designed Traffic Analysis System for real-time vehicle counting of multiple CCTVs.  
For real-time inference, we used HLS(HTTP Live Streaming) and Socket Programming.  
To deal with sudden overloads of model requests, we made an waiting queue that stacks batches from multiple CCTVs.

We applied our Traffic Analysis System to a National Highway API provided by <a href="https://www.its.go.kr/map/cctv"> National Transport Information Center</a>, Korea and implemented a Web-based service and an android app.
