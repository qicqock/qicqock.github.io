<p class="font-weight-bold">Research Project of POLBOT at <a href="https://www.etri.re.kr/intro.html">ETRI, Korea </a> mentored by <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ls--5v0AAAAJ&hl=en'>Prof.Junseong Bang</a></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

POLBOT is an AI-based conversational voice bot that provides an automated reception service for call centers of <a href="https://minwon.police.go.kr/">Korean National Police Agency</a>.

For effective reception, Dialogue State Tracking (DST) is one of the key modules of POLBOT that is responsible for extracting usersâ€™ intentions and requirements from dialogues.

As the recent trends of DST largely rely on Pre-trained Lanuage Models(PLMs), POLBOT also uses PLMs to track dialouge states.

However, Due to difficulties of acquiring well-anotated datasets from the police department, few-shot DST is a main issue in our research projects.


<p class="font-weight-bold"> We proposed FCN-BLA and implemented real-time Traffic Analysis System.</p>

We proposed FCN-BLA that Improved the architecture of a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.09476">FCN-rLSTM</a> with BI-LSTM and Attention.

Compared to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.09476">FCN-rLSTM</a>,  
    1. Changed to an Encoder-Decoder architecture  
    2. Bidirectionally containing spatio-temporal information from sequential images  
    3. Directly referring to encoded input features for dealing with an existing bottleneck problem
