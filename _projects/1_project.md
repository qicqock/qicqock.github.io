<h3>Introduction</h3>

POLBOT is an AI-based conversational voice bot that provides an automated reception service for call centers of <a href="https://minwon.police.go.kr/">Korean National Police Agency</a>. 

For effective reception, Dialogue State Tracking (DST) is one of the key modules of POLBOT that is responsible for extracting usersâ€™ intentions and requirements from dialogues.

However, Due to difficulties of acquiring well-anotated datasets from the police department, few-shot DST was a main topic of our research project.

<h3>Reserach Approach </h3>

Among few-shot methods, I was particularly interested in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01552">DS2</a> that redefines DST into sentence summarization. 

However, I found some inefficiencies of the training process of DS2  
    1. Because of redefinition of DST, the approach requires an extra fine-tuning process, which needs additional computational resources for training.  
    2. it is very challenging to optimize all of the parameters of a large model with very little data.  

<p class="font-weight-bold">To address the issues while maintaining few-shot performance of DS2, I applied prompt-based learning. </p>


<h3>Prompt-Based methods of DST</h3>

<h3>Result</h3>
I obtained a 98% comparable score of fine-tuning with updating only 2% parameters of the BART-large model.

My proposed application also showed almost similar accuracy to fine-tuning in various few-shot settings conducted on MultiWOZ 2.1 dataset.
